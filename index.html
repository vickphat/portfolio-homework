            <p>
                Hello! My name is Vicheka Phat. However, I like to go by the name of Vick.
                I am an Asian-American born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. My nationality
                75% Chinese and 25% Cambodian. However, I am only fluent in Cambodian. I have been 
                married for 4 years. My wife and I have a 2 year old daughter. I am part owner of a nail salon 
                that is located in Westlake, Ohio. I have been a manicurist for about 10 years. Even though I am 
                part owner of this nail salon, I do not feel any passion behind it. To me, this is just
                another job and not a career. I have always been fascinated by computers and technology. The pc
                that I am currently using, I built it myself. Mainly for video games.
