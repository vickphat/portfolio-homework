# PORTFOLIO

For this homework assignment, I was tasked with creating a portfolio page.

<h2>The following list is the acceptance criteria:</h2>

    * GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    * WHEN I load their portfolio
    * THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to   sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    * WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    * THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    * WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    * THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's  applications
    * WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    * THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    * WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    * THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    * WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    * THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


<h2>What I Did</h2>
I decided to keep my portfolio nice and simple. I decided to do a color scheme 
of red, black and grey with the text being white. I put my name in the top left corner with a red background to make it stand out a bit more. I also put my navigation links for the portfolio up there as well on the right hand side. With the links, when the mouse hovers over it, it creates a red and blue border around it to highlight which link will be clicked. 

After that, I put my most recent picture under my name. It then goes into my first section which is the "About Me" section. Under that section, I put my "Work" section. According to the acceptance criteria, I made the first application image bigger than the rest. Also, in the mock up, it seemed that there was a glow effect while hovering over the image. I have added that into my code as well. As of right now, I have not done any applications yet. Hence, I will be placing placeholder images. Also, to test that the images are clickable and will take me to another site, I am using google as the link source. In the future, when I start developing applications, I will update this portfolio images and links. The third section will be my "Contact" section. In this section, I placed my email, phone number, github link and a LinkedIn. I did not put a link for my LinkedIn page as I have not updated it yet. Finally, the last section is the resume section. I have added my resume in this section. However, after this bootcamp, I 
will update my resume. 

I added media queries into my CSS to give my portfolio a reponsive layout.

# UPDATED PORTFOLIO

For this updated version of my portfolio, I kept the color scheme the same with a few minor tweaks. I implemented Bootstrap into my code. I switched out my previous navbar for Bootstraps navbar. I also added some FontAwesome icons. For my profile picture and "About Me" section, I decided to combine those two together by adding a Bootstrap card. In the application section, I decided to go with Bootstraps carousel to create a slide show with 3 of my applications. The first slide is an application of my first group project. The second is my password generator application. The third slide is my weather dashboard application. I have the title on the lower left hand side and the techonology that I used on the right hand side. The pictures are also clickable. By clicking the image, it will redirect you to my deployed application. 

In the contact section, I added a link to my LinkedIn. I also added icons here as well. For my resume, I decided to create a seperate page for it. By clicking the "Resume" link in the navbar, you will be taken to my resume. Here, it will show 2 images of my resume. At the very bottom, there will also be a link to download a PDF version of my resume. I did also change the "About Me" link at the top to show "Home" instead so that way, when clicked, it will bring the user back to the default page.
