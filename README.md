#PORTFOLIO

For this homework assignment, I was tasked with creating a portfolio page.

<h2>The following list is the acceptance criteria:</h2>

    * GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    * WHEN I load their portfolio
    * THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to   sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    * WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    * THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    * WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    * THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's  applications
    * WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    * THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    * WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    * THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    * WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    * THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

I decided to keep my portfolio nice and simple. I decided to do a color scheme 
of red, black and grey with the text being white. I put my name in the top left corner with a red background to make it stand out a bit more. I also put my navigation links for the portfolio up there as well on the right hand side. With the links, when the mouse hovers over it, it creates a red and blue border around it to highlight which link will be clicked. 

After that, I put my most recent picture under my name. It then goes into my first section which is the "About Me" section. Under that section, I put my "Work" section. According to the acceptance criteria, I made the first application image bigger than the rest. As of right now, I have not done any applications yet. Hence, I will be placing placeholder images. In the future, when I start developing applications, I will update this portfolio. The last section will be my "Contact" section. In this section, I placed my email, phone number, github link and a LinkedIn. I did not put a link for my LinkedIn page as I have not updated it yet.
